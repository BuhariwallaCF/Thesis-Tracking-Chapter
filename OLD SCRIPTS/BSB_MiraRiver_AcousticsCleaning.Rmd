# this script is to be used for each analysis invloving Mira River Data. It has been scrubbed & its purpose is to stop the repetition from older scripts.

```{r}
require(lubridate)
require(dplyr)
require(qdap)
```

read in data and metadata
```{r}
mrdf <- read.csv("Raw Data/MIRA_RIVER_ALL_YEARS_TIME&STATION_CORRECTED.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE, dec = ".")
tagdf <- read.csv("Raw Data/BSB_MR_tagging.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, skip = 4, header = TRUE, sep = ",", dec = "." )
stndf <- read.csv("Raw Data/bsb_condensed_metadata_2012-2015_UpdatedStations.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE, header = TRUE, dec = ".")
```

use cleaning function. detailed cleaning instructions in function  
```{r}
source("functions/acoustic_cleaning_fun.R")
mrdf <- acoustic_cleaning_fun(mrdf)
```

format the tag sheets into something useful 
```{r}
source("functions/tag_cleaning_fun.R")
tagdf <- tag_cleaning_fun(tagdf)
```

filter out tags that don't belong to me, arrange data frame by date, and make sure there are no duplicates
```{r}
mrdf <- mrdf[mrdf$id %in% tagdf$id,] # filters out 8060 detections 
mrdf <- arrange(mrdf, date) # need dplyr
mrdf <- distinct(mrdf) # same same 
```

now that there is a lull in the action, it may be a good time to enter calibrated sensor values
```{r}
#sensor conversion formula  y = mx + b == .43970x -1.7587
mrdf$sensor <- ifelse(mrdf$unit == "ADC", mrdf$sensor <- 0.43970*mrdf$sensor-1.7587, mrdf$sensor <- mrdf$sensor) 
mrdf$unit <- ifelse(mrdf$unit == "ADC", "meters", mrdf$unit)
```

Cleaning up Stations 
```{r}

```

Add River Zone* 
```{r}

# NEW 2016-06-13 this is based on natural divisions within the estuary (according to me see above note)

zone df for possible deployment shit.. 
```{r}
zonedf <- read.csv("Raw Data/bsb_mr_zones.csv")
zonedf$depl_date <- ymd_hms(zonedf$depl_date)
zonedf$recov_date <- ymd_hms(zonedf$recov_date)

# tag - identifying tag deployment, and last day of activity of tag, then create an interval of tag activity

tag.end <- mrdf %>% group_by(id) %>% select(id, date) %>% summarise(recov_date = max(date))
tagdf <- merge(tagdf, tag.end, by = "id")

### since the receivers were pulled on 2015-05-25, tag ids: 33160 33161 33158 33162 33159 were supposed to have tags active for longer period of time and will have a tag end date of 2015-05-26 so as to be included in all possible deployment time
long.tags <- c("33160", "33161", "33158", "33162", "33159")

 for(i in 1:length(tagdf$id)){
  if(tagdf$id[i] %in% long.tags){tagdf$recov_date[i] <- ymd_hms("2015-05-26 00:00:01")}}
```

```{r}

tagdf$activity_interval <- new_interval(tagdf$depl_date, tagdf$recov_date)
tagdf$days_active <- tagdf$recov_date - tagdf$depl_date
## station  - use the station metadata to create an interval of deployment and recovery 
stndf$activity_interval <- new_interval(stndf$depl_date, stndf$recov_date)
stndf$days_active <- stndf$recov_date - stndf$depl_date
## ZONE
zonedf$activity_interval <- new_interval(zonedf$depl_date, zonedf$recov_date)

Remove all tag data associeated with tags prior to their official deployment
```{r}
#### remove tag data associated with tags prior to their official deployment ####
remove.tagdf <- NULL
for(i in tagdf$id){
  temp <- mrdf[mrdf$id == i & mrdf$date < tagdf$depl_date[tagdf$id == i],]  
  len <- length(temp$date)
  temp$tagdate <- rep(tagdf$depl_date[tagdf$id == i], times = len)
  remove.tagdf <- rbind(remove.tagdf, temp)
}

mrdf <- anti_join(mrdf, remove.tagdf, by = c("date", "id")) ### this is a beautiful little piece of code right here... always remember
mrdf <- arrange(mrdf, date)
```

clean up the environment
```{r}
remove(temp,remove.tagdf,backup.stndf,tag.depl,tag.end, i, len, long.tags, acoustic_cleaning_fun, station_cleaning_fun, tag_cleaning_fun)
```

write out the new data files as csvs so they can be used for all future files
```{r}
mcsv_w(mrdf, stndf, tagdf, zonedf, dir="Data")
```

## I have changed the inherent structure of the data frames/codes to make things work better 
## mr.df, stn.df, tags.df, zone.df, have all lost their '.'. 
## tags.df == tagdf
## calculated intervals now == activty_int
## tagdf$end_date is now tagdf$recov_date
